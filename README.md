# PubMedToSheet

## This is a python script which facilitates the creation of a sheet and import of pubmed data in a specified format

Required modules: Biopython (for Entrez/Pubmed access), TKinter, OpenPyXl (for Excel functionality)

A spreadsheet is generated and populated with studies:

1) A study is looked up via its PMID (PubMed ID Number).

2) A preview of the study appears with its relevant data. A confirmation dialog asks to confirm the desired study, and lists potential errors in data (i.e. missing data/fields)

3) Upon confirmation, the study is added to the sheet. The sheet is saveable at any time.
